# HourlyFocus

HourlyFocus is a productivity tracking app built with Flutter that helps users log their hours as "Productive" or "Unproductive" and visualize their daily performance via a pie chart. The app includes features like voice input for notes, CSV export, and lock screen interaction on iOS for quick logging without unlocking the device.

- **Pie Chart Visualization**: View todayâ€™s productivity stats in a Syncfusion pie chart.
- **CSV Export**: Export logs to a CSV file for external analysis.
- **Lock Screen Interaction (iOS)**: Receive hourly notifications on the lock screen with "Productive" and "Unproductive" buttons to log hours without unlocking.
